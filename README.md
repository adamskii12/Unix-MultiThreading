This program demonstrates multithreading by incrementing a global counter variable 'sum' by five different producer threads, along with a print thread running simultaenously. A mutex (mutual exclusion lock) is used to grant exclusive access to the critical region (which increments the global sum variable) to prevent multiple producer threads from accessing the sum variable at the same time (race condition) and hence produce incorrect results. The print thread is created first followed by the five print threads. This allows the print thread to lock the mutex first, initiating the condition variable 'wait' call, putting the print thread to sleep until a singal is fired. The signal fired will be from one of the five producer threads once all five producer threads have finished incrementing the global sum variable. The print thread then resumes and prints the final sum of global sum variable to the output.
